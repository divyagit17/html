        PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY
    </a>

    <h1>Personal Responsibility</h1>
    <p> 
        moral responsibility is the status of morally deserving praise, blame, reward, or punishment for an act
         or omission in accordance with one's moral obligations.[1][2] Deciding what (if anything) counts as 
        <strong>"morally obligatory"</strong> is a principal concern of ethics.<br>
            Moral responsibility is often contrasted with <b>legal responsibility</b>, which is the status of being subject to legal penalties. Philosophers refer to people who have moral responsibility for an action as "moral agents".
         Agents have the capability to reflect upon their situation, to form intentions about how they will act.</p>
